# Subtract Before You Add

When evolving a system, remove complexity first, then build.

**Why:** adding to a complex system compounds complexity. Removing first
leaves less code, reveals the essential structure, and usually makes the next
design obvious.

**The pattern:**

- Sequence removal before construction.
- Cut before you polish: reach the minimum before investing in quality.
- Design for observed usage, not speculative edge cases.
- No speculative validators, parsers, or guards beyond what the spec demands.
- When a reference has no novel content, delete it rather than leaving a stub.

Leave the design slightly simpler and more capable behind the same or smaller
surface than you found it.
